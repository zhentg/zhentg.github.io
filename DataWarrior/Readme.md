DataWarrior(abbr. DW) is "A Free Cheminformatics Program for Data Visualization and Analysis".
- DW's website: http://www.openmolecules.org/datawarrior/index.html
- DW's forum: http://openmolecules.org/forum/index.php?t=index
  - DW is actively maintained. You can raise questions to the developers. I posted several questions, and they were either answered or fixed quickly, much appreciated.

After some practices of DW, I feel it is a very good tool to MedChem research. And I'd like to share my experiences here.
